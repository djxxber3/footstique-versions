    <h2>3. Your Choices and Opt-Out Rights</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy and provide you with the ability to control personalized advertising. You can opt out of ad personalization through your device settings. This action will not stop you from seeing ads, but they will be less relevant to your interests.</p>

      <li><code>android.permission.INTERNET</code>: Allows the app to connect to the internet to stream video content and fetch advertisements.</li>
      <li><code>android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code>: Allows the app to check the status of the network connection.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We value your trust in providing us your information and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
